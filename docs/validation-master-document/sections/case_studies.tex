\section{Case Studies}
This section will include the description of each analyses performed, with it objectives and conclusions.\newline

Each benchmark problem is associated with experimental observations that are going to be numerically reproduced. Multi-purposes comparative analyses are defined for each test case to find the models accuracy linked to different computational strategies.\newline

Benchmarks for NSBL, SBL, and CBL configurations, refer to test cases that consider from simple-shaped obstacles to complex topography as geometry. All selected test cases address the unitary problems that characterise urban environments.\newline



In order to be able to access accuracy of computational models while providing useful results of reduced-order modelling, the validation procedure will follow 
this order: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item test cases associated with simple-shaped obstacles to not be limited by the domain sizes;
    \item test cases associated with complex topography (staying
in the wind tunnel with simplified city-like geometries)
    \item final analyses will against field experiments in a real-world urban environment (for the final step of validation/evaluation for the complete problem of microclimate simulations in urban environments) 
\end{itemize}
