    This paper reviews methods to evaluate the performance of air quality
  models, which are tools that predict the fate of gases and aerosols upon
  their release into the atmosphere. Because of the large economic, public
  health, and environmental impacts often associated with the use of air
  quality model results, it is important that these models be properly
  evaluated. A comprehensive model evaluation methodology makes use of
  scientific assessments of the model technical algorithms, statistical
  evaluations using field or laboratory data, and operational assessments by
  users in real-world applications. The focus of the current paper is on the
  statistical evaluation component. It is important that a statistical model
  evaluation exercise should start with clear definitions of the evaluation
  objectives and specification of hypotheses to be tested. A review is given of
  a set of model evaluation methodologies, including the BOOT and the ASTM
  evaluation software, Taylor's nomogram, the figure of merit in space, and the
  CDF approach. Because there is not a single best performance measure or best
  evaluation methodology, it is recommended that a suite of different
  performance measures be applied. Suggestions are given concerning the
  magnitudes of the performance measures expected of “good” models. For
  example, a good model should have a relative mean bias less than about 30{\%}
  and a relative scatter less than about a factor of two. In order to
  demonstrate some of the air quality model evaluation methodologies, two
  simple baseline urban dispersion models are evaluated using the Salt Lake
  City Urban 2000 field data. The importance of assumptions concerning details
  such as minimum concentration and pairing of data are shown. Typical plots
  and tables are presented, including determinations of whether the difference
  in the relative mean bias between the two models is statistically significant
  at the 95{\%} confidence level.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Advances in scientific computing have made modelling and simulation an
  important part of the decision-making process in engineering, science, and
  public policy. This book provides a comprehensive and systematic development
  of the basic concepts, principles, and procedures for verification and
  validation of models and simulations. The emphasis is placed on models that
  are described by partial differential and integral equations and the
  simulations that result from their numerical solution. The methods described
  can be applied to a wide range of technical fields, from the physical
  sciences, engineering and technology and industry, through to environmental
  regulations and safety, product and plant safety, financial investing, and
  governmental regulations. This book will be genuinely welcomed by
  researchers, practitioners, and decision makers in a broad range of fields,
  who seek to improve the credibility and reliability of simulation results. It
  will also be appropriate either for university courses or for independent
  study.%
