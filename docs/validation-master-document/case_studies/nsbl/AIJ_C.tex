    \textbf{Objectives:} ....
    \begin{itemize}
        \item grid sensitivity analysis with steady state simulation (standard grid related analysis);
        \item Application of computational methodology defined at the previous step
        \item reduced order modelling with respect changing inflow boundary conditions
        \item sensitivity analyses on turbulence models, numerical schemes, boundary conditions, and the effects of dimensionality reduction via intrusive ROM (validation-oriented study).
    \end{itemize}
    \textbf{Conclusions:} .... .\newline
